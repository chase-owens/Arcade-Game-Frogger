===============================

## Project 3 Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree

In this project, students were provided this [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) and this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric).

It provided experience with OOP and canvas to make an game. 

### The game

Move that player character around using the arrow keys. The goal of the game is to cross the road, avoid the enemies driving by, and get to the water.

Have fun and thanks for checking it out!
